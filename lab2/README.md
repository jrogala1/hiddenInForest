You're a junior java developer in a company called Mex. Your first assignment is to write a simple program that'll generate
email addresses for new employees. Email address should be build using following patter: surname.name@mex.com
In case of people with the same surname and name, there should be a number added to the name - ie. twain.mark@mex.com and twain.mark1@mex.com

I must be possible to provice a name and surname of new employee from keyboard in console. Then program should print generated email address.
There're two approaches to hold information that can be used here:

- data about employees can be stored in the memory and will be gode once program is closed
- data about employees can be stored in the text file
